    pk: 37
    fields:
        question: 19
        text: Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In rockets, the expulsion of gas out of the engine creates a thrust in the opposite direction.

    fields:
        question: 19
        text: Newton's Third Law states that objects in motion remain in motion. In rockets, this means a rocket will continue to move forward indefinitely once it starts.
